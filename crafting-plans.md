new standalone program ("workbench.lua" or something)

immediately aim for recursive autocrafting
- it's roughly the same difficulty as provide-based autocrafting

state must be maintained
- one file per machine, keeping track of what's in the machine

all transfers will happen via hopper.lua
- **with limited rescans so that it's actually performant**
	- this must be done first before work on workbench.lua can start


recipes will be registered per machine group
multiple machines can be of a given machine group
each machine can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs
```lua
recipe = {
	input1 = "minecraft:cobble",
	machine = "smelter"
	output1 = "minecrat:stone",
}
smelter1 = {
	group = "smelter",
	input1 = "*furnace* -to_slot 1",
	output1 = "*furnace* -from_slot 3",
}
smelter2 = {
	group = "smelter",
	input1 = "chute_2",
	output1 = "hopper_8",
}
```

no UI initially
UI can later be added with:
- pixelui, primeui, basalt, ...
- *custom lib*
	- two kinds of components: flexbox div and textbox
	- textboxes automatically lay out the text and overflow with scroll
	- flexbox divs also overflow with scroll
	- buttons are just text boxes again


UI will be used for an artist-like storage system with a crafty turtle
the crafty turtle will automatically learn recipes you craft
and write them to an autogenerated list of crafting bench recipes
